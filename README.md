# FullScreenManager

This repo contains an example usage of the utility class "FullScreenManager". 

If you just want the class itself, you can get it from this [gist](https://gist.github.com/gabriel-rajadurai/16c09fafa33ee2dc64dcc2645ec9750c).
Do note that this is a modified version of the class. You can find the original by following the link below.

**Note: I do not own this class or the idea. I got this off from [Android YouTube Player repo](https://github.com/PierfrancescoSoffritti/Android-YouTube-Player)**
